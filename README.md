Design and development of a SAT-based algorithm for extension computation in abstract argumentation.

Starting from P.M.Dungâ€™s work on argumentation theory in the field of Artificial Intelligence, a C/C++ efficient software, based on an external library and the open-source application ArgSemSAT, that determines the set(s) of nodes of a directed graph that are acceptable according to a set of constraints.
